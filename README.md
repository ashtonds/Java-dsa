# Java DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) 📘

Welcome to **Java DSA**, a hands-on learning repository where I practice and explore core **Java programming concepts**, basic data structures, and algorithm exercises. This project focuses on building a strong foundation in Java before moving on to advanced DSA topics.

## 📍 Overview

This repository is created for beginners who want to:

- Learn Java programming fundamentals
- Practice logic building with loops, arrays, and methods
- Understand 1D and 2D array operations
- Prepare for data structures and algorithms interviews
